# local-pad-sign
Generate your own local etherpad sign with QR to print and help your neighbours

This page creates a printable poster with a QR-code (using [QRCode-SVG](https://github.com/papnkukn/qrcode-svg/)) to an collaborative document generated from an etherpad instance.

Also uses [github-fork-ribbon-css](https://github.com/simonwhitaker/github-fork-ribbon-css) for the "fork-me" ribbon on the page.
